I'm tired

I have no idea what to put here, but salutations!

I’m interested in engineering and computer based science, specifically looking at UAV and weapons tech. I’m currently learning how to code in Java, more to come.

Find me on discord with the username "slingingpanther", that's about it.

Wanted more on me? Well too bad! Ill expand/add this more in the future anyways. Fairwell.
